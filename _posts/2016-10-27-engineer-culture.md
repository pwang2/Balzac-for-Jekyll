## What is Engineer Culture

_source: (Chinese) http://coolshell.cn/articles/17497.html_

Four years ago, I presented on Qcon about "How to build a strong core team" in which I mentioned Engineer culture. Today, I want to write another post about Engineer Culture. One reason is I have some more thoughts and takeaways; In the other side, I am on my voyage to my startup dream, undoubtedly, to create a strong team or company with strong engineer culture, it will be necessary to consolidate my thoughts to paper works to warn myself to comply to. (If I did not comply in the future, I will be shamed by what I am writing here).

### Why Engineer culture
looking back into the recent 2 decades, Computer and internet has infiltrated to every corner of our life. All kinds of computer technologies stand as the develop engine of the whole world, enumerators innovation no matter it targets businesses or technologies all are thriving by the involving of the technology. Technology becomes the backbone of liberating productivities and social effectiveness. Led by United States' technology innovation companies are changing the world and people's life and work habits.

Today, every professional devoted in IT industry should feel luck for that.  Because we have chosen the right industry and moreover, we are born at the right ear when we could feel unprecedented aspiration and change. Comparing to our parent generation, it is really our lucky to go through an age like this. The lucky bird like us only need to thing about one question--are we stay at the right place doing the work in the right way?

In my opinion, There are 3 types of business companies. 
* Operation or sales driven. These companies excel in business operation and marketing. Technology to them is moreover to support their large scale operation and marketing, cost control, etc. So, not so much innovation needed. The problem of these companies is lack of safety margin.
* Product driven. These companies are good at creating product to improves people's daily life's experience from innovation. Technology to them, besides supporting tremendous（PCU) Peak concurrent users, they are seeking innovations to enhance user experience, improve the business efficiency and technology innovation. e.g. UI interactive, business processes. Problems to them are the copycats.
* Technology driven. These companies believe technology could change the world. They are leveraging their strong engineering technology to create earthshaking things. Mostly of the innovation are using automation to replace human, e.g. Steamer machine replace human labor, digital technology replaces the information transmission. Now, these companies are hoping to using AI to replace stupid human for decision making. The problem to them is not all innovation are welcomed by the audience.

All these 3 types of companies are tended to success; but they also have their problems. But, unexceptionally, they all need powerful technology support. The only difference is the put technology in different precedence. 

No matter how much you despise technology personals, you cannot deny your life today rely on those engineers a lot. Without then, you probably don't know how to survive. Chairman Deng said a few decades ago, Science and technology constitute a primary productive force. No matter what kind of science and technology theory will rely on advanced engineering technology.

So, today, as an IT or internet company, engineer culture is not a problem, but a common sense.

In a nutshell, I could classify all kinds of engineer culture to 2 types: freedom and efficiency. (It would be an innovation type, But IMHO, innovation's precondition is under freedom environment with the obsession to technology which will result innovation itself).

Innovation is not emerging out of nothing. Looking back to human history, it is not hard to find, all kinds of innovations are those fundamental improvements which think from the out side of the box. For example, communication, transportation, healthcare, education, sociology,.. All of them are optimizing efficiency.

So, if you spirit is not free, it will be hard for you to thinking outside the box. You can never find a way out in your rigid mental world. If the innovation is not targeting efficiency, the innovation may not be favorite.

So, I think, engineering culture is freedom + efficiency.

### Freedom
First of all, engineering culture means innovation culture, engineers are innovation pioneers because skillful mind will easily thing to build something new. In the meantime, the source of innovation is from the liberate of the spirit. Only free spirit would generate all kinds of whimsies, impossible crazy ideas and imaginations, all of them will lead to innovation breakout. 

Spiritual freedom is in the forms of
* Self-driven. Self-management is the best management. Parental or baby sitter style management are the worst management. Only work for interest could yield real motivation.
* Flexible working hours and locations. Engineers are doing intellectual work, not a typical workforce. Flexible working hours and locations will make engineers' brain more efficient. Working remotely is a good work style. Open source communicates are all with remote style. More about the Remote topic could refer to 37Signal's [Remote](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00C0ALZ0W) book.
* Information equality. This means all employees will get the raw information instead of those cascading administrator digested information. Information mask will cause misunderstanding and totally wrong action easily. Information equality could include things as big as business strategy, direction, goal, financial, or as small as documentation, source code, knowledge base sharing. It also reflects as the equal opportunity to express opinions. Everyone has the equal opportunity to express his/her opinions and suggestion. This would inspire more thoughts and speculation which may results a way better alternative. The worse scenario is everyone knows about the problem but no one would like to share their take. In Google, besides source code sharing, there is TGIF (Thank God It's Friday) culture. Every Friday, all executives will present to answer all kind of critical questions from the employees. In Amazon, source code and documentations are shared to all employees. Financial reports are open to employee too. All principle SDE gurus have a "Principle talk" at times. Amazon also has a culture called "Up the river"; every year, A group of smart minds will be elected to discuss company's future and strategy, the result KPI from the discussion will be handed in to SVP directly.
* Don't be afraid of mistakes. The right way to handle mistake is analyzing from the lesson rather than punish the culprit. The former one proceeds on the improvements; the later one let people down. The biggest mistake is people afraid of making mistake. The biggest problem is not facing problem.
* Loosen authorizing system even ditch them. Authorizing means 3 things. 1) lack of trustiness, 2) tedious processes, 3) thought restrain. All of them are the enemies of innovation and creativity. The heavier the administration, authorization, processes are, the worse vitality the company behaves.
* 20% free time. This is from Google. Employee will have 20% of free time doing their hobby projects. This is also how Gmail come out.

### Efficiency
Engineers are natural efficiency seekers. Someone think Developers spend tons of time for automation tools which is not even as economical as doing it manually. They argue, writing a automation script may take 5 hours comparing to repeat it manually for 200 times in 3 hours is not worth it. People like these are not really understand engineering.

One side, A tool could be reuse in a share manner, more people could benefit from it. I may spend 5 hours to develop this tool and next time I only need to spend 1 hour to modify it for other usage. This is future proof which is more than what we could see now. More importantly, this is a culture, a culture about efficiency which will drives more case like this. If A developer was criticized about spending time to develop automation tools and be deemed as inefficient, you are killing the culture of efficiency.

The reason human beings are smarter than other animals is human beings could use and crate tools. There are is an old Chinese idiom "to do a good job, an artisan needs the best tools". A company's competency is in execution force and execution force lies in the tools support it. These are not only engineer culture but also human culture.

Be specific to engineer culture, especially software engineering, here are the expressions of engineering efficiency improvements:
* Simplicity. Simplicity is not crude. Simple things mean easy to understand, easy to maintain and operate. Alibaba is popularizing a culture called "Simple but beautiful". Steve Jobs also said "No user manual is the best user manual"; Amazon's "Working backwards" requires a new product or feature, product manager need to write 3 documentations: media press release, user manual, FAQ, the total length of these 3 documentations should be less then 2 A4 pages. No image illustration is allowed just for make the product simple and easy to use.
* Promote automation brutally! The essence of writing program is automation. Automation is not just eliminating the human repetitive work, but more importantly, human cannot win machine for a lot of things. For example, adding a machine, program could finish in seconds, human can never achieve such speed. Another example, E-commerce program could process and manage huge number of orders automatically, no matter how many people we add, we could never be as fast, accurate as machines. Automation need to spare no effort on development of efficiency tool. e.g.: CI, CD, automatic infrastructure devOps, even automation operation tools.
* Avoid inefficient organization and management. It embodies with, 
    1. Flat org chart structure
    2. replacing supporting work with automation tools
    3. full stack team with less than 10 members
    4. farm out by product/feature rather than skills
    5. **meeting only for voting proposal instead of discussion solution** 
    6. reduce communication and decision derive by product goal and tenets. In Amazon, all BUs, all teams and all products have their individual tenets. Tenets specify DO and DONS. This avoids most dispute and trade-off decision. For example, in AWS team's tenets, it says that "DevOps is the highest priority" which means anything complicate DevOps will be rejected. It also says "Throughput & latency cannot worsen" which means, feature need to yield performance. 
* Correct component abstraction. Abstraction is part of simplicity. On the one side, abstraction means reusability and universality; on the other side, abstraction means extensibility; more importantly, abstraction means the output of technology capacity, no matter to other peer teams or general public. For example, Google's MapReduce, BigTable, ProtoBuffer, Facebook's Thrift, Amazon's Coral Service (Web Service Framework), Timber (Log monitoring tool), Amazon internal Lock framework(A distributed lock framework)
* Develop high quality code. High quality code could be modified and maintains with much less hassle, It also alleviates production support burden which allow us to spend more time with more creative work. High quality code demands rigorous design review, code review, and testing.
* Raise the hiring bar and hire the best ones. In Sunzi's great work "The art of wars", there is a famous assertion--"求其上，得其中；求其中，得其下；求其下，必敗”. (translation: if you are targeting superior ones, you will get something ordinary; if targeting ordinary ones, you will get something inferior; if you just satisfy with inferior, you will lose definitely). If a company or a team want to become better and stronger, high standard need to be established. To meet this high standard, we need to continuously educate and recruit better team members. In Amazon and Google's interview committee, there is always one guys called Bar Raiser.
* Create a Kaizen (continuous improvement) culture. A good team will progress with reflections. This need to be an overall effort. From micro aspect, at the end of each project, there would be a retrospective meeting to identify the gains and loss of the project. When issue occurs, there would be a root cause analysis meeting. In Amazon, for critical issue, we need to write a COE (Correction of errors) documentation. There is a "Ask 5 Whys" section to force you reflect. From macro aspect, a company need to carry out some annually working data analysis or employee survey. For example, whether we have hired some awesome guys, how is the ROI, where did employ spend most of the time to work with, etc. Then we could use technology approach to improve. Amazon's annual engineer survey is the most detail one ever in my life. The questions not only about company, manager, culture, but also about routine work, dev environment, CI, test automation, product quality, software architecture, software maintenance, live issue process, annual plan, Data center building, general polling, etc. This survey directly guides Amazon's engineering decision making.

### How to foster engineer culture
To make culture to be carried out in the company, where are a few means to select from,
* Political approach. 3 key areas--recruiting, performance review and promotion. For example, if you want to emphasis the simplicity and automation in your culture, when hiring, we need to hire developers like simplicity and automation, then in performance review, set a KPI about these metrics. If not reached, sorry! no promotion and the performance review need to be degrade as well.
* Economical approach. How to make the cost not doing this greater than doing. Then, normal people will choice the low cost solution. For example, if you want to promote design/code review/unit testing to reach the quality goal, let alone your QA team and Ops team, ask your Dev team to test, maintain. Then after dev team keep repeating manual testing and deal with silly live issues, they will voluntarily write automation test and do code review. And your QA and OPs team are just helping dev team to develop tools, testing and operation are dev's ownership. Finally, they will realize the cost skipping code review and unit test is way bigger than doing. Undoubtedly, they will choice a low cost way.

Finally, there are a few preconditions:
* Team need to be small. Ownership is important, Eat your own dog food. Pains generate motivation.
* Be passionate about studying and trying. Trying new technologies, new horizon, new thinking modal, or stay still will keep just make you spiral.
* As a boss trust technology instead of management. Trusting technology will solve the problem with technology; Trusting management will find the answer from policy, process, value, etc.

### Others
About OT, to engineer, when they are solving problem or being creative, they are extremely conscious. No need to be impelled, engineers are the readiest to work hard employees. Too much pressure generates hatefulness, this would not be what managers want. (some managers are the worst as they make everyone only do what has been assigned by frustrating, criticizing voluntariness, then they are able to "manage" them). ☹️
